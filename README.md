# BEAMER-2k25-GPC
Made a script for 2k25 that would help you consist shots. (Cronus Zen)

This script is just for the perfect tempo for rhymth shots, Hold LB or L1 for it to start the jumper and release at the set point for your jumper.
Same said with the fade shot, hold Left Stick Press or "L3" and release when you reached ur set point for your jumper.

I Use a xbox 360 controller so please feel free to change it to your desired one, a step by step will be placed below:

## Too slow or too fast? ##

Very Slow,Very Fast, Slightly Slow and Slighly fast and all be tweaked in the menu.
LT + Back or View (xbox)
L2 + Share (playstation)
(in menu left and right corresponds to the direction you want to increase or decrease the time)
In the menu if you press down you can go into the fade delay settings.
