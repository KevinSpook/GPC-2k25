Made a script for 2k25 that would help you consist shots. (Cronus Zen)

I Use a xbox 360 controller so please feel free to change it to your desired one, a step by step will be placed below:

Open the script up in zen studio, do CTRL + F to open the find/replace tool.
After opening the tool place XB360 at the first box (find) then place your abriviated controller name in the replace box (replace).
Simply press replace all.

Now for xbox one controllers simply find "BACK" and replace it with "VIEW"

Play station users 4 and 5 please also find "BACK" and replace it with "SHARE"

Play station 3 users find "BACK" and replace it with "SELECT"

PS5 = PS5
