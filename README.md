Made a script for 2k25 that would help you consist shots. (Cronus Zen)

I Use a xbox 360 controller so please feel free to change it to your desired one, a step by step will be placed below:

## Open the script up in zen studio, do CTRL + F to open the find/replace tool. ##

After opening the tool input XB360 and replace it with your controller.
PS5 = PS5
PS4 = PS4
PS3 = PS3
XBOX ONE = XB1

## There are still a list of things you're going to have to replace: ##

Ps4 & 5 = Replace "BACK" with "SHARE"
XBOX ONE = Replace "BACK" with "VIEW"
Ps3 = Replace "BACK" with "SELECT"

## Play station: ##

replace "LB" with "L1"
replace "LT" with "L2"
replace "LS" with "L3
replace "B" with "O"
